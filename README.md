# C_VaccingCenter_Threads
A vaccination centre consists of a registration desk (reg_desk) and from one to ten vaccination stations (vac_station). Members of the public arriving at the centre present themselves to the registration desk; the registration desk then enqueues such person (an instance of PersonInfo) at onto a single queue used for the whole centre (queue). That is, this single queue is an sequence of persons – in essence ordered by arrival at the registration desk – who are now queued up for a vaccination station to become available. (Multiple people arriving at the same time must be enqueued in the order in which they arrive at the registration desk.)
